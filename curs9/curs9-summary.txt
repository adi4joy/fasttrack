	Overriding:
		- when extending a superclass, you can re-define or add unto the existing logic. You do this by defining a method with the same name and signature as the one from the base-class. 
		- in order to call the one from the parent, you can use 'super' reserved word

	Overloading:
		- the concept of overloading is not really related to inheritance
		- you can overload methods
		- in order to overload methods, you just need to define a new method that has the same name as the existing one, but different arguments
		eg.
			public void drive()...
			public void drive(int speed)...
			public void drive(int speed, int direction);

	Polymorphism:
		- many forms
		- polymorfism is the concept throu which a variable defined with a genreic type can behave differently depending on their implementation.
		- ALWAYS use the most generic class you can to define an object instance;

	FINAL:
		- the reserved word 'final' can be used for classes, fields and methods
		- when it's on the class it means that the class can't be extended
		- when it's on the method, it means that the method can't be overriden
		- when it's on the fields, it means that the reference of the variable can't be changed.
