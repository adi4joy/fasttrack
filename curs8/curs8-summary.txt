	Interfaces:
		- describes the behavior of a class. 
		- does not provide implementation
		- does not have fields / state;
		- cannot be instantiated
		- can be implemented by a class or extended by another interface
		- implementing an interface means giving it implementation for all defined methods

	Static:
		Static defines a class-level method or field
		If you donâ€™t define a field/method as static, each instance of that object will refer to a different object
		Static fields are on the class object, not on the instance. So all instances will share the same reference.
