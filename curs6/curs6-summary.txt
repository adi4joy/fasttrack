Conversions:
	String to Integer : Integer.parseInt(string)
	String to Double  : Double.parseDouble(string)
	any object to String : String.valueOf(<object>)



	 Formatting:
	 	String.format(<pattern>, <vars>...)
	 	pattern can contain:
	 		%d for integer numbers
	 		%s for strings
	 		%d for decimal numbers

Reading data from file:
- we use Scanner with a FileReader

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new FileReader("test.txt"));
	- when you do this you need to put throws FileNotFoundException in the caller function
	    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {


	- then read it as we do with System.in:

	- next()       - reads next word
	- nextLine()   - reads the whole line
	- nextInt()    - reads next int
	- nextDouble() - reads next double
	- hasNext()    - returns true if there are words to read
	- hasNextInt() -  returns true if there are integers to read

also, you can use a FileInputStrean
       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new FileReader("test.txt"));
	as with FileReader, you need to put throws FileNotFoundException
